We offer two versions of GPCC and demo data for the users, the light version (less than 5 MB) and the standalone version (About 833 MB). The light-version GPCC is provided for the users who have a MATLAB (2017b or above) installed on his computer, while the standalone-version GPCC can be directly installed on your computer without the library support from MATLAB. The demo data (in station Churchill, Canada) for running GPCC is also provided.
